# Code Property Graph 

This is the core CPG library used in Monoid code-scanning, forked from the 
[Fraunhofer AISEC library](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/cpg). This fork
has improved support for Golang, along with several speed improvements to help
performance on larger repositories.

See the core [Monoid Repo](https://github.com/monoid-privacy/monoid) for the
code-scanning CLI tool and more.
